# Deployment Strategy

## 1. Infrastructure
- **Cloud Service**: Choose AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure free tiers.  
- **Compute**: Use small instances (e.g., t2.micro on AWS) or serverless for minimal cost.  
- **Database**: Use managed services under free tier or low-cost plans.  

## 2. Containerization
- **Docker**: Create Dockerfiles for each service (backend, frontend, etc.).
- **Orchestration**: For small projects, Docker Compose may suffice; for larger scale, consider Kubernetes.

## 3. Access Control
- **Limit Access**: Use security groups or ingress rules to allow only specific IP addresses or set up HTTP Basic Auth for client demos.
- **HTTPS**: Use a free SSL certificate (e.g., Letâ€™s Encrypt) to secure traffic.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Branch Strategy**: Keep production code on a main branch and merge changes via pull requests.

## 5. Monitoring & Logging
- **Cloud Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch or GCP Cloud Logging for logs and metrics.
- **Alerts**: Set up basic alerts for downtime or errors via email or Slack.

## 6. Scalability
- **Stateless Services**: Keep application services stateless; use a shared managed database.
- **Load Balancing**: Scale horizontally behind a load balancer once traffic grows.

## 7. Cost Optimization
- **Shut Down**: Turn off non-essential test environments when not needed.
- **Track Usage**: Monitor monthly usage bills and adjust instance sizes accordingly.

## Instance Sizing
- **Baseline**: Start with a low-cost instance type (e.g., t2.micro).
- **Metrics**: Continuously monitor CPU, memory, and network usage.
- **Load Testing**: Stress-test your app to understand peak capacity.
- **Scaling Up**: Upgrade to a larger instance (e.g., t3.small, t3.medium) if you consistently exceed resource thresholds.
- **Iterate**: Periodically evaluate instance usage as product demands grow.
